					<h3>Academic Projects</h3>
					<p><strong>Implementing a stock predictor: </strong>Implement website for stock transactions with login. Coding was done in Java, HTML, Python, PHP and JavaScript.
					-Predict stock curves and suggest user to buy and sell stocks, machine learning algorithms have been used to accomplish this.</p>
					<p><strong>Design of a 4-bit processor: </strong>Building a 4-bit processor with 4- bit ALU that performs all the basic arithmetic and logic operations, along with storage registers. The code written in VHDL is dumped into an FPGA and tested on it.</p>
					<p><strong>Malware analysis: </strong>Analyze a virus sample and reverse engineer the sample using IDA Pro or OllyDbg.  
					Analyze the instruction level code to perform ‘Static and Dynamic analysis’, thereby develop an Anti-Malware detection algorithm.</p>
					<p><strong>Account management system: </strong>Implement a system which will manage a stock portfolio account and a bank account. Implemented as derived classes in C++.
					Implement a GUI, linked lists to store the portfolios and account info, and plot the portfolio variation in MATLAB.
					</p>
